### Hi there 👋

I am Vatsal, and I went to Northeastern to know more about ~~huskies~~ data and machine learning.

My experience encompases building end-to-end Machine Learning Systems, including scalable data pipelines and deploying machine learning models into production.

🔭 Currently, I am a Data Engineer at Bank OZK by day and an avid cricket player by night.

📚 In the data world, my current explorations are scalable data pipelines, user-centered AI, LLM's and a bit of system design.

**Here is my profession experience in a nutshell:**

🏦 **Bank OZK (2023-Present)**: I work as a Data Engineer in the second-line enterprise risk management, building high volume and scalable data pipelines supporting the Model Risk team in building in-house challenger models, supporting bank's $30 billion dollar loan portfolio.

🍓 **Ahold Delhaize (2022)**: I worked as a Data Scientist, Engineered high-impact business solutions for the E-Commerce and Digital Team, developing scalable machine learning models, utilized 25TB of historical sales and search data, applying GenAI (Large Language Models) yielding powerful product and search recommendations.

⚙️ **Crest Coders (2019-2020)**: Worked as a Data Engineer, facilitated data-driven insights for Merchandising Team, implementing cloud-native data solution, leveraging AWS and Databricks

🤖 **Off-Track Thinkers (2018-2019)**: Data Scientist, getting to know more about data and started building data related projects.

**2017** - Caught a deadly data bug, and started experimenting with data and machine learning
